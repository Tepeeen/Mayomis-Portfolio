                <p>Transitioning to the University of the Cordilleras as a second-year student, College for me now is a transformative chapter where I am embarking on a journey of self-discovery, intellectual growth, and independence.

                <h4>Experience</h4>
                <p>While juggling the roles of a student leader, student-facilitator, while also being a student is like trying to keep several plates spinning at once. Every day is a balancing act, trying to stay on top of my own studies while also guiding and helping others. Time feels like it's always running out, leaving little space for rest or reflection. Despite the challenges, there's a determination to make it work and to help everyone succeed. It's tough, but every obstacle overcome feels like a victory, reminding me of my strength and purpose. In the end, despite the struggles, the satisfaction of seeing everyone grow and learn makes it all worthwhile.</p>
